# WONDERHOY!!! — Hackathon Write-Up

**WONDERHOY!!!** is a fast-paced, rhythm-based *whack-a-mole* game featuring chaotic fun and iconic characters like **Emu**, **Pandui**, **Robone**, and **Fishkasa**. The gameplay challenges players to *whack the correct moles* (who are, naturally, our charming characters) in sync with the beat—combining reaction speed with musical rhythm to achieve high scores and unlock bonus interactions!

## 🎮 What Our Product Does

Players are immersed in a colorful, musical carnival where hit objects appear in time with the beat. Each mole that pops up represents a character with their own unique animations and sounds. The game rewards accuracy, timing, and combo streaks — all while keeping players entertained with expressive character reactions and flashy effects.

Key gameplay features include:

- 🎵 **Beat-matched mole spawning** for rhythmic play  
- 🕹️ **Combo streaks & scoring system** to encourage skill  
- 🎭 **Animated characters** reacting to whacks — from Emu's cheer to Fishkasa’s pout  
- ⚡ **Dynamic difficulty** that scales with performance

## 🛠️ Technologies We Used

To bring WONDERHOY!!! to life, we leveraged the following technologies:

- **🎮 Unreal Engine 5** — our core platform for game development, chosen for its powerful Blueprint system, audio syncing capabilities, and rapid prototyping of rhythm mechanics.  
- **💻 Visual Studio** — our integrated development environment (IDE) for scripting, debugging, and managing build processes for our Unreal project.  
- **🌐 GitHub** — used for version control and collaboration. With branches for gameplay logic, UI design, and asset integration, we ensured safe merges and efficient teamwork across the board.

## 💡 Technical Highlights

- Implemented beat synchronization using Unreal’s `Tick` system for precision timing  
- Created custom C++ to spawn hit targets and register player inputs with time windows  
- Used Unreal’s animation system to rig and trigger character expressions based on player actions  
- Developed our own rhythm chart parser to make level design customizable and scalable

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

**WONDERHOY!!!** combines energetic gameplay, lovable characters, and rhythm game flair in one polished package. Our use of industry-grade tools like Unreal, Visual Studio, and GitHub empowered us to build, iterate, and jam in record time — just like a well-timed combo streak! 🎉
